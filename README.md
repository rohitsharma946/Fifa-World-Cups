# Fifa-World-Cups
I used visualization dashboard Tableau to create an attractive dashboard FIFA World Cups.
The dashboard shows World Cup wins by country, teams with the most finals and semi-finals, a timeline of results from 1930-2014, host country details,yearly competition stats, top teams per year, and the number of times each country has qualified for the World Cup.
The dashboard effectively visualizes historical World Cup data, making it easy to analyze trends and key statistics through interactive and clear visual elements.
